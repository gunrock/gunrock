<h1 id="gunrock-gpu-graph-analytics" align="center">Gunrock: GPU Graph Analytics</h1>

Gunrock is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the GPU. It uses a high-level, bulk-synchronous, data-centric abstraction focused on operations on a vertex or edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge.

For more details, please visit our [website](http://gunrock.github.io/), read [Why Gunrock](#why-gunrock), our TOPC 2017 paper [Gunrock: GPU Graph Analytics](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9gj6r1dj), look at our [results](#results), and find more details in our [publications](#publications). See [Release Notes](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/release_notes.html) to keep up with the our latest changes.

Gunrock is featured on NVIDIA's list of [GPU Accelerated Libraries](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-libraries) as the only external library for GPU graph analytics.

## Getting Started with Gunrock

- For Frequently Asked Questions, see the [FAQ](#faq).

- For information on building Gunrock, see [Building Gunrock](#building-gunrock).

- The "tests" subdirectory included with Gunrock has a comprehensive test application for most the functionality of Gunrock.

- For the programming model we use in Gunrock, see [Programming Model](#programming-model).

- We have also provided code samples for how to use [Gunrock's C interface](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/master/shared_lib_tests) and how to [call Gunrock primitives from Python](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/master/python), as well as [annotated code](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/annotated_primitives/annotated_primitives.html) for two typical graph primitives.

- For details on upcoming changes and features, see the [Road Map](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/road_map.html).

## Results and Analysis

We are gradually adding summaries of our results to these web pages (please let us know if you would like other comparisons). These summaries also include a table of results along with links to the configuration and results of each individual run. We detail our [methodology for our measurements here](#methodology-for-graph-analytics-performance).

For reproducibility, we maintain Gunrock configurations and results in our github [gunrock/io](https://github.com/gunrock/io/tree/master/gunrock-output) repository.

We are happy to run experiments with other engines, particularly if those engines output results in our JSON format / a format that can be easily parsed into JSON format.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the following developers who contributed code: The connected-component implementation was derived from code written by Jyothish Soman, Kothapalli Kishore, and P. J. Narayanan and described in their IPDPSW '10 paper *A Fast GPU Algorithm for Graph Connectivity* ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470817)). The breadth-first search implementation and many of the utility functions in Gunrock are derived from the [b40c](http://code.google.com/p/back40computing/) library of [Duane Merrill](https://sites.google.com/site/duanemerrill/). The algorithm is described in his PPoPP '12 paper *Scalable GPU Graph Traversal* ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2370036.2145832)). Thanks to Erich Elsen and Vishal Vaidyanathan from [Royal Caliber](http://www.royal-caliber.com/) and the [Onu](http://www.onu.io/) Team for their discussion on library development and the dataset auto-generating code. Thanks to Adam McLaughlin for his technical discussion. Thanks to Oded Green for his technical discussion and an optimization in the CC primitive. Thanks to the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) and [Vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) teams in the [Interactive Data Lab](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington for graphing help. We appreciate the technical assistance, advice, and machine access from many colleagues at NVIDIA: Chandra Cheij, Joe Eaton, Michael Garland, Mark Harris, Ujval Kapasi, David Luebke, Duane Merrill, Josh Patterson, Nikolai Sakharnykh, and Cliff Woolley.
